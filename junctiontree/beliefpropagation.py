        Construct trees with nested lists as:

        [array, axis_keys, child_tree1, ..., child_treeN]

        where each child tree has the same syntax recursively.

        Axis keys are some unique identifiers used to determine which axis in
        different array correspond to each other and they are used directly as
        keys for numpy.einsum. It should hold that len(axis_keys) ==
        np.ndim(array). TODO: numpy.einsum supports only keys up to 32, thus in
        order to support arbitrary number keys in the whole tree, one should
        map the keys for the current numpy.einsum to unique integers starting
        from 0.
